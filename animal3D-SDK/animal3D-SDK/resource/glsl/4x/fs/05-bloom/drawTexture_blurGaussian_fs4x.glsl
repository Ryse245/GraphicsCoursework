// ****TO-DO: 
//	0) copy existing texturing shader
//	1) declare uniforms for pixel size and sampling axis
//	2) implement Gaussian blur function using a 1D kernel (hint: Pascal's triangle)
//	3) sample texture using Gaussian blur function and output result

uniform sampler2D uImage00;

layout (location = 0) out vec4 rtFragColor;

//center = center pixel, dir = next/prev pixel
vec4 blurGaussian0(in sampler2D img, in vec2 center, in vec2 dir) //pascal 0th row
{
	return texture(img, center);
}

vec4 blurGaussian2(in sampler2D img, in vec2 center, in vec2 dir) //pascal 2nd row
{
	vec4 c = vec4(0.0);
	c+= texture(img, center) * 2.0;	//2 is middle of 2nd row of pascal's triangle
	c+= texture(img, center+dir);	//1 on sides of pascal triangle
	c+= texture(img, center-dir);	//1 on sides of pascal triangle

	//for more distant nums in pascal triangle, multiply dir? (ex. center +/- (dir*2.0))?
	
	//return(c/4.0);
	return (c*0.25);	//c * 0.25 = c/4, 4 is added values from pascal triangle row (2+1+1)
}

void main()
{
	// DUMMY OUTPUT: all fragments are OPAQUE MAGENTA
	rtFragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
}

//TIP FOR BONUS: implement multiple blur/bright passes
//TIP FOR BONUS: use 1st, 3rd, etc. rows instead of even rows for 3rd bonus (no idea how)
